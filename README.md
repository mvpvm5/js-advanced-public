# JavaScript Advanced Lesson — practical assignments completed during my studies at college this semester

This project contains exercises to practice advanced JavaScript concepts. Follow the instructions for each exercise precisely. The automated tests will check your work against these exact requirements.

## Exercises

### 1. Array Methods
- **Task 1.1**: Create a function named `filterEvenNumbers` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the even numbers. Use the `filter()` method.
- **Task 1.2**: Create a function named `doubleNumbers` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with each number doubled. Use the `map()` method.
- **Task 1.3**: Create a function named `sumArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all numbers. Use the `reduce()` method.

### 2. Closures
- **Task 2.1**: Create a function named `createCounter` that returns a function. The returned function should increment and return a counter each time it's called, starting from 0.
- **Task 2.2**: Create a function named `createMultiplier` that takes a number `multiplier` as a parameter and returns a function. The returned function should take a number and return it multiplied by the `multiplier`.

### 3. Async/Await and Promises
- **Task 3.1**: Create an async function named `fetchUserData` that returns a Promise resolving to an object `{ id: 1, name: "John Doe" }` after 100ms delay.
- **Task 3.2**: Create an async function named `processData` that takes a number as a parameter, waits 50ms, then returns the number multiplied by 2.

### 4. Classes and OOP
- **Task 4.1**: Create a class named `Person` with a constructor that takes `name` and `age` parameters. Add a method `introduce()` that returns the string `"Hi, I'm [name] and I'm [age] years old."`.
- **Task 4.2**: Create a class named `Rectangle` with a constructor that takes `width` and `height` parameters. Add a method `getArea()` that returns the area of the rectangle.

### 5. Destructuring and Spread
- **Task 5.1**: Create a function named `getFirstAndLast` that takes an array and uses destructuring to return an object with properties `first` and `last` containing the first and last elements of the array.
